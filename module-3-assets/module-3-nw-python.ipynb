    "Before we try to write actual alignment code, let's make sure we're comfortable iterating over the cells of our array. Basically this means setting up code that lets us visit each cell in the array one by one - like running our finger along a table to read each row one by one from top to bottom. \n",
    "\n",
    "To visit a cell in the table, we need it's *index*, which is the row and column number for that cell. So to visit all the cells, our main challenge is to generate each row and column number one by one. To do this we will set up an outer `for` loop that iterates over each row one by one, setting each row number to a variable (here I call this variable `row_index`, but `i` is most commonly used in real code). Within each loop over the row numbers, an inner `for` loop iterates over each column number one by one and sets its value to a variable (here I use `col_index`, but `j` is most typically used in real code). Inside both loops, we will have a value for the current row and column number. We can use these to index into the scoring array using array indexing (`scoring_array[row_index,column_index]`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the short code snippet below, let's practice this setup, and use it to number each cell of the array by the order in which we visit it. This can help show us visually what order our code is visiting the cells of our array."

However, in reality, some types of substitutions are much more common than others in many biological systems. For example, transitions within purine (A or G) or pyrimidine (C or T) nucleotides tend to be much more common than transversions that cross these classes (e.g. A --> T or G --> C). We can capture such differences by building a scoring function for mismatches.\n",

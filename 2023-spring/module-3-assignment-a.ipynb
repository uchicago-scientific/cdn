    "You are given two sequences `AGATTAC` and `AGTTAC`. Assume a match score of `1`, a gap penalty of `3` and a substitution score of `-1`. Using these scores, obtain the global alignment of these two sequences manually (ie. on a piece of paper) in the following two steps:\n",

Use this to check your work. Make sure that you are using the same scoring and gap penalty values."
